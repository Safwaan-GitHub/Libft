# Libft: Your Personal C Library ðŸ”§ðŸ“š

Welcome to `libft`, my personal library of C functions that I've built to ease the pains of programming in C. This repository is a testament to my journey as a budding programmer at `42 London`, showcasing my understanding of C through the recreation and augmentation of standard library functions, as well as some additional handy utilities that any C aficionado would appreciate.

As a student delving into the core of system programming and with an eye on cyber security and app development, I've crafted `libft` to be a solid, expandable foundation for all my C projects.

## About Libft

`libft` is more than just a coding project; it's a testament to my growth as a programmer. It started as an assignment to recode a set of the standard C library functions as defined by `man`, as well as some additional ones that have proven to be useful during my coding journey.

## Features

- **Comprehensive String Handling**: Functions for manipulating C strings are abundant and tested for edge cases.
- **Memory Manipulation**: Safe and efficient memory handling functions that keep the bugs away.
- **Custom Data Structures**: Implementation of lists and other data structures to support complex algorithms.
- **Utility Functions**: A collection of functions ranging from character checks to math operations to expand the toolkit provided by the standard library.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:Safwaan-GitHub/libft.git

# Change directory
cd libft

# Compile the library
make

Now, you can include libft.h in your C projects and use the functions as you would with the standard C library.
